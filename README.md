## GUIDE
For years, 
1.)try to make the first date the year in which the person released their first major public work 
2.) the second year is not required. if used, it indicates that the person, place, or thing extended beyond the first year and had a definite end. 
3.) If the person, place, thing is still ongoing, enter "now." Works of art are the excecption. ALthought ongoing (see "is/was"), only their date of creation matters. 

Example: Britney Spears' "...Baby One More Time" released in 1999 and she's still alive, so the years would be "1999" and "now".

* was/is - any works of art that are still generally available are considered part of the present and therefore should be refered to with "is" or "are." 

* refName should appear exactly as it did in the quote. If it is a nickname, or shortened to just a first name, then address this in is/was. Ex" Flo Jo (instead of Florence Griffith Joyner) or Melville (instead of Herman Melville)
or "Oprah" -> Oprah (Winfrey) is a popular talk show host."
