## Dev Notes
When you first run the app, you may get a warning about 'Synchronous XMLHttpRequest...' Don't worry. It's part of how Firebase
works and is addressed in this [StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32467144/firebase-synchronous-xmlhttprequest-deprecated).

Remeber when you ejected the create-react-app becauase you wanted SCSS? Maybe just try using post-css loader, as shown in the "Webpack" usage section of Autoprefixer npm page: shttps://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer (loader: "style-loader!css-loader!postcss-loader")
